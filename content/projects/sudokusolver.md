Built a powerful Prolog-based Sudoku solver capable of tackling Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
<!--more-->

#### Description 
For this project, I wanted to create an agent capable of solving 4x4 and 9x9 sudoku problems. The agent should take a board as input (through CL) and ouput the fully solved board.


#### Solution
Renowned for its symbolic and logical reasoning capabilities, prolog's ability to handle complex constraints and logical relationships makes it the ideal choice for Sudoku puzzle-solving. My final solution solves the problem using a single function to ensure no rules are broked.
